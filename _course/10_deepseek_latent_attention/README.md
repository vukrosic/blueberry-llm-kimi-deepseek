# Module 10: DeepSeek Latent Attention

Welcome to Module 10! This module delves into advanced attention mechanisms, specifically focusing on the innovative **Latent Attention** architecture employed in DeepSeek models.

While standard Multi-Head Attention directly computes attention scores between all query-key pairs, latent attention introduces an intermediate, smaller set of "latent" tokens or memories. This can lead to more efficient computation and potentially better performance by forcing the model to distill information into a more compact representation.

## Lessons in this Module:

1.  **What is Latent Attention?**: Understanding the core concept and its advantages.
2.  **DeepSeek Attention Architecture**: A detailed look at the specific design choices in DeepSeek's implementation.
3.  **Implementation in Code**: Building the DeepSeek Latent Attention mechanism in PyTorch.

Let's explore how DeepSeek leverages this mechanism to enhance its Transformer architecture.
