# Module 9: Building a Complete Transformer

Welcome to Module 9! After covering the fundamental components of modern neural networks, we are finally ready to assemble a complete Transformer model from scratch.

This module will guide you through the final steps of integrating the attention mechanism, feed-forward layers, and positional encodings into a cohesive, powerful architecture capable of understanding and generating language.

## Lessons in this Module:

1.  **Transformer Architecture**: A high-level overview of the full Transformer architecture.
2.  **RoPE Positional Encoding**: A deep dive into Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE).
3.  **Building a Transformer Block**: Combining multi-head attention and the feed-forward network.
4.  **Residual Connections & LayerNorm**: The "glue" that enables deep networks.
5.  **The Final Linear Layer**: Projecting the model's output into a probability distribution over the vocabulary.
6.  **Full Transformer in Code**: Assembling the complete model in PyTorch.
7.  **Training a Transformer**: A conceptual overview of the training process.

Let's begin!
