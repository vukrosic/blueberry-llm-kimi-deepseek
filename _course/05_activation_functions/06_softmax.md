# Activation Functions: Softmax

Softmax is a unique activation function because it's not applied element-wise in the same way as the others. Instead, it's applied across a vector of scores and converts them into a probability distribution.

## 1. The Goal: Convert Scores to Probabilities

Softmax is used almost exclusively as the final activation function in a **multi-class classification** network.

Imagine a network trying to classify an image into one of three categories: "cat", "dog", or "bird". The final linear layer of the network will output a vector of raw scores (logits), one for each class.

`logits = [2.5, 1.8, 3.2]`  (score for cat, dog, bird)

Our goal is to convert this vector of arbitrary scores into a vector of probabilities that sum to 1.

## 2. What it Does

The Softmax function is defined as:
`Softmax(zᵢ) = eᶻᵢ / Σ(eᶻⱼ)`

In simple terms, for each score `zᵢ` in the vector `z`:
1.  Calculate `e` raised to the power of `zᵢ`. This makes all scores positive.
2.  Sum up all the exponentiated scores from step 1.
3.  Divide the result of step 1 by the result of step 2.

This process ensures two things:
- Every output value is between 0 and 1.
- The sum of all output values is exactly 1.

## 3. How to Use It

Let's apply Softmax to our example logits.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Raw output scores (logits) from a model for a single sample
# Scores for "cat", "dog", "bird"
logits = torch.tensor([2.5, 1.8, 3.2])

# Apply the softmax function
# We specify dim=-1 to apply it across the last dimension of the tensor
probabilities = F.softmax(logits, dim=-1)

print(f"Original logits:   {logits}")
print(f"Probabilities:     {probabilities}")
print(f"Sum of probs:      {torch.sum(probabilities)}")
print(f"Predicted class index: {torch.argmax(probabilities)}")
```

The output shows the model's confidence for each class. The highest probability corresponds to the "bird" class (index 2), so that would be the model's prediction.

## 4. Softmax vs. Sigmoid

- **Sigmoid**: Used for **binary** classification (one output neuron). The output is the probability of the positive class.
- **Softmax**: Used for **multi-class** classification (one output neuron *per class*). The outputs represent a probability distribution across all classes.

You can think of Sigmoid as a special case of Softmax where the number of classes is 2.

## 5. Numerical Stability: Logits and LogSoftmax

In practice, calculating `eᶻ` can lead to very large numbers, causing numerical instability (overflow). PyTorch has a more stable way of handling this by working in "log space".

- **LogSoftmax**: `F.log_softmax(logits, dim=-1)` calculates the log of the probabilities directly in a stable way.
- **Cross-Entropy Loss**: The standard loss function for multi-class classification, `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss`, is designed to take the *raw logits* as input. It internally performs a LogSoftmax and then calculates the loss.

**Best Practice**: For multi-class classification, your model should output the raw logits and you should use `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss` as your loss function. You only need to apply Softmax explicitly when you want to view the final probabilities for interpretation.

## 6. Practice Examples

### Practice 1: Temperature
The "temperature" of a Softmax function can be controlled by dividing the logits by a scalar `T` before applying the function: `F.softmax(logits / T, dim=-1)`.
- A high temperature (`T > 1`) makes the probabilities more uniform (less confident).
- A low temperature (`T < 1`) makes the probabilities more extreme (more confident).

Take the `logits` from our example and apply Softmax with `T=3.0` and `T=0.5`. What happens to the output distribution?

### Practice 2: Batch of Logits
Models make predictions for a whole batch of samples at once. Your logits tensor might have a shape of `(batch_size, num_classes)`, e.g., `(4, 3)`.

Create a random `(4, 3)` tensor of logits. Apply `F.softmax(dim=-1)`. Check the shape of the output. Then, verify that for each sample in the batch (each row), the probabilities sum to 1.

This concludes our series on activation functions! You've seen the classical functions, modern replacements, and the special functions used for classification outputs.
