## The Learning Paradox

Learning AI can feel circular at times. For example, to understand backpropagation you need to know neural networks, but to understand neural networks you need to understand backpropagation. Don't despair - this is completely normal.

There will be moments when concepts seem impossible or you'll experience imposter syndrome, feeling like you don't understand as well as others. But by persisting and learning anyway, everything will eventually click into place.

## Your Success Mindset

**Don't compare yourself to others - compare yourself to yesterday's you.**

Every expert was once a beginner. Focus on your own progress and celebrate the small victories along the way.
