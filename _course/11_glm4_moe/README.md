# Module 11: GLM-4 Mixture of Experts (MoE)

Welcome to Module 11! We've previously explored the general concept of Mixture of Experts (MoE) layers as a way to scale Transformer models efficiently. This module will take a closer look at the specific implementation and architectural nuances of the MoE layer as found in models like GLM-4.

GLM-4, a powerful large language model, leverages MoE to achieve impressive performance while managing computational costs. Understanding its MoE design can provide valuable insights into building and scaling next-generation LLMs.

## Lessons in this Module:

1.  **Revisiting Mixture of Experts**: A quick recap of MoE fundamentals and why it's used.
2.  **The GLM-4 MoE Architecture**: A detailed examination of GLM-4's specific MoE design, including gating mechanisms and expert configurations.
3.  **Implementation in Code**: Building a GLM-4 style MoE layer in PyTorch.

Let's dive into the specifics of GLM-4's approach to sparse activation.
