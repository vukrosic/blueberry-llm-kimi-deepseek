# 02: The GLM-4 MoE Architecture

Now that we understand MoE fundamentals, let's explore how GLM-4 specifically implements this technology. GLM-4 represents the current state-of-the-art in MoE design, incorporating sophisticated engineering solutions and clever optimizations that make it both powerful and efficient.

## GLM-4's Design Philosophy

GLM-4 follows a **"capacity-first, efficiency-second"** philosophy. Instead of thinking "how do we make our model cheaper," GLM-4 asks "how do we make our model smarter while keeping it deployable." This mindset drives every architectural decision.

## The GLM-4 MoE Specifications

### Scale and Scope
GLM-4 MoE models typically feature:
- **Expert Count**: 64 to 128 experts (far more than many previous models)
- **Expert Capacity**: Each expert is a substantial Feed-Forward Network (4M+ parameters)
- **Activation Strategy**: Top-2 or Top-4 routing (only 2-4 experts active per token)
- **Total Parameters**: Can reach hundreds of billions while maintaining efficient inference

### Expert Architecture
Each GLM-4 expert is built as a sophisticated FFN:

```
Input Tokens → [Expand] → [Activate] → [Contract] → Output Tokens
     ↑              ↓           ↓            ↓           ↑
    dim →      hidden_dim → hidden_dim → dim
    (512)         (2048)       (2048)      (512)
```

**Key Design Choices**:
- **Expansion Ratio**: Typically 4× (512 → 2048 → 512)
- **Activation Function**: Often GELU or SwiGLU for modern performance
- **No Bias Terms**: Follows contemporary best practices (removes trainable biases)

## The GLM-4 Router: Smart Decision Making

The routing mechanism is the brain of GLM-4's MoE system. Here's how it makes decisions:

### Router Architecture
```
Input Token Embedding (X) 
         ↓
    Linear Layer: X → (n_experts)
         ↓  
     Softmax Activation
         ↓
   Expert Probabilities
         ↓
   Top-K Selection
         ↓
   Routing Weights
```

### Routing Decision Process

1. **Feature Extraction**: The router examines the token's embedding vector (say, 512 dimensions)

2. **Expert Scoring**: Projects to `n_experts` logits using a learnable linear layer:
   ```
   expert_logits = Linear(input_embedding)  # Shape: (1, n_experts)
   ```

3. **Probability Calculation**: Applies softmax to get expert probabilities:
   ```
   expert_probs = Softmax(expert_logits)  # Sums to 1.0
   ```

4. **Top-K Selection**: Selects the K experts with highest probabilities:
   ```
   top_k_indices = TopK(expert_probs, k=2)  # Get indices of top 2
   top_k_probs = expert_probs[top_k_indices]  # Get their probabilities
   ```

5. **Load Balancing**: Ensures no expert is overused via auxiliary loss terms

## A Real-World Routing Example

Let's trace how GLM-4 might route different tokens:

```
Token Input: "function" (code-related)
↓ Router examines embedding
↓ Router probabilities: [0.6, 0.05, 0.25, 0.1, ...]  
↓ Selects experts: Expert 1 (code) + Expert 3 (syntax)

Token Input: "beautiful" (language-related)  
↓ Router examines embedding
↓ Router probabilities: [0.1, 0.55, 0.3, 0.05, ...]
↓ Selects experts: Expert 2 (language) + Expert 3 (semantics)

Token Input: "cosmic" (scientific/abstract)
↓ Router examines embedding  
↓ Router probabilities: [0.08, 0.12, 0.7, 0.1, ...]
↓ Selects experts: Expert 3 (abstract concepts) + Expert 4 (science)
```

Notice how the router learns associations between token patterns and expert specializations!

## Expert Specialization in GLM-4

Through training, GLM-4's experts naturally develop specialized capabilities:

### Semantic Specialization
- **Domain Experts**: Some experts specialize in specific fields (medicine, law, engineering)
- **Style Experts**: Others focus on writing styles (formal, casual, technical, creative)

### Linguistic Specialization  
- **Syntax Experts**: Handle grammatical patterns and sentence structure
- **Semantic Experts**: Work with meaning, context, and conceptual relationships
- **Stylistic Experts**: Manage tone, register, and communication style

### Cross-Lingual Specialization
- **Language Experts**: Different experts may specialize in different languages
- **Translation Experts**: Dedicated experts for cross-lingual understanding
- **Cultural Context Experts**: Specialists in cultural and regional linguistic variations

## Load Balancing Strategies

GLM-4 uses several techniques to ensure balanced expert usage:

### 1. Router Temperature Scaling
```
adjusted_logits = expert_logits / temperature
```
Higher temperature → softer probabilities → more diverse routing

### 2. Load Balancing Loss
```
load_balancing_loss = -∑(i=1..n_experts) expected_usage_i × log(expected_usage_i)
```
Encourages uniform expert utilization across the dataset

### 3. Expert-Level Dropout
Random dropout applied to expert outputs during training prevents over-dependence on single experts

### 4. Capacity Constraints
Limits the maximum number of tokens any single expert can process in a batch

## The GLM-4 Training Process

Training a GLM-4 MoE model involves sophisticated distributed computing:

### Expert Parallelism
- **Expert Sharding**: Different experts stored on different GPUs/servers
- **Cross-Expert Communication**: Efficient data routing between devices during routing decisions
- **Load Balancing**: Dynamic redistribution based on computational load

### Gradients and Updates  
- **Expert Isolation**: Each expert receives gradients only for tokens routed to it
- **Router Updates**: The router learns from routing success patterns
- **Synchronization**: Periodic synchronization of expert parameters across devices

## GLM-4's Computational Efficiency Innovations

### Sparse Attention Integration
GLM-4 combines MoE with other efficiency techniques:
- **Sparse Attention**: Reduces quadratic complexity in attention layers
- **Gradient Checkpointing**: Reduces memory usage during training
- **Mixed Precision**: Uses half-precision for non-critical computations

### Dynamic Expert Activation
- **Adaptive Routing**: Router confidence influences expert selection
- **Context-Aware Load Balancing**: Adapts expert usage based on task complexity
