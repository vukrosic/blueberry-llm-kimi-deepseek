# Lesson 4: The Chain Rule - The Engine of Backpropagation

Welcome back! We've built a neural network that can make predictions. But how does it learn? The answer is **backpropagation**, and the engine that drives it is a concept from calculus called the **chain rule**.

## What is the Chain Rule?

In simple terms, the chain rule is a way to find the derivative of a function that is composed of other functions.

Imagine you have a series of nested machines. The first machine takes an input `x` and produces an output `y`. The second machine takes `y` and produces `z`.

- `y = g(x)`
- `z = f(y)`

So, `z` is ultimately a function of `x`: `z = f(g(x))`.

The chain rule tells us how a change in `x` affects `z`. It states that the rate of change of `z` with respect to `x` is the product of the rate of change of `z` with respect to `y` and the rate of change of `y` with respect to `x`.

Mathematically, it looks like this:

```
dz/dx = dz/dy * dy/dx
```

## A Real-World Analogy

Think about driving a car:

1.  You press the **gas pedal** (`x`).
2.  This changes the **engine's RPM** (`y`).
3.  The change in RPM affects the **car's speed** (`z`).

If you want to know how much the car's speed changes when you press the gas pedal (`dz/dx`), you can figure it out by knowing:

-   How the speed changes with RPM (`dz/dy`).
-   How the RPM changes with the gas pedal (`dy/dx`).

The overall effect is the multiplication of these two individual effects.

## Why is this Important for Neural Networks?

A neural network is just a big, nested function. The output of one layer is the input to the next.

- The input `x` goes into the first layer to produce an output `a1`.
- `a1` goes into the second layer to produce `a2`.
- ...and so on, until we get the final output and calculate the loss.

To train the network, we need to figure out how the **loss** changes with respect to each **weight** and **bias** in the network. Since the weights are deep inside the network, we use the chain rule to propagate the gradient of the loss all the way back to each weight.

This process of using the chain rule to calculate gradients is what we call **backpropagation**.

In the next lesson, we'll see how to apply the chain rule to a single neuron.
