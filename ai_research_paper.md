## Introduction

The Blueberry LLM represents our approach to democratizing large language model training by making it accessible on consumer hardware, with our experiments demonstrating feasibility on modern GPUs including RTX 4090 with the ambitious goal of training LLMs for under $1. Our mixture of experts (MoE) language model leverages cutting-edge DeepSeek components and optimization techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency through sparse activation patterns. This technical report presents three comprehensive experiments that systematically evaluate DeepSeek's innovations within the Blueberry LLM framework: (1) a comprehensive ablation study across 5 different configurations revealing the true impact of different architectural components; (2) a learning rate optimization study for DeepSeek Attention + MLP architectures; and (3) a comprehensive optimization study for DeepSeek Attention + GLM4 MoE architectures. These experiments collectively demonstrate the feasibility of cost-effective LLM training on consumer hardware.

Our Blueberry LLM architecture combines the efficiency benefits of MoE with the performance improvements offered by DeepSeek's innovative components. The model employs a top-2 routing strategy across 8 experts, allowing for specialized processing while maintaining computational tractability.

DeepSeek has introduced several innovative components that enhance traditional transformer architectures:
* **LoRA-style Q/K/V projections**: Low-rank adaptation techniques for efficient parameter updates
* **RoPE scaling**: Rotary Position Embedding scaling for better positional encoding
* **Attention bias**: Additional bias terms in attention computations
* **DeepSeek RMSNorm**: Enhanced root mean square layer normalization

Our research objectives for the Blueberry LLM are to:
* Conduct comprehensive ablation studies to understand component interactions and dependencies across 5 different configurations
* Evaluate the effectiveness of DeepSeek attention mechanisms within MoE architectures compared to standard multi-head attention
* Investigate DeepSeek MLP architectures and their integration with MoE systems across different model sizes
* Analyze DeepSeek MoE implementations and their performance compared to baseline approaches
* Optimize learning rates for DeepSeek Attention + MLP architectures to achieve optimal performance
* Optimize DeepSeek Attention + GLM4 MoE architectures with systematic expert count and routing analysis
* Identify optimal architectures that balance performance, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness across all three experimental paradigms
* Provide quantitative analysis of performance, efficiency, and parameter usage for MoE models with DeepSeek components
* Demonstrate the feasibility of training high-performance LLMs on consumer hardware for under $1
* Establish the Blueberry LLM as a practical solution for accessible AI development
