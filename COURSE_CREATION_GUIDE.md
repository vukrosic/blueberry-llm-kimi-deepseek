# Course Creation Guide

This guide explains how to create effective course markdown files based on the structure and patterns used in the `_course` folder.

## Course Structure Overview

The `_course` folder follows a hierarchical structure:
- **Course folders**: `01_python_beginner_lessons/`, `02_math_not_scary/`, etc.
- **Lesson files**: `01_python_basics.md`, `02_control_flow_and_loops.md`, etc.

## File Naming Convention

- **Course folders**: `XX_topic_name/` (e.g., `01_python_beginner_lessons/`)
- **Lesson files**: `XX_lesson_name.md` (e.g., `01_python_basics.md`)
- **Numbering**: Use zero-padded numbers (01, 02, 03...) for proper sorting

## Lesson File Structure

Each lesson should follow this structure:

### 1. Title and Introduction
```markdown
# Lesson Title

Brief introduction explaining what this lesson covers and why it's important.
```

### 2. Learning Objectives
```markdown
## Learning Objectives
- Clear, actionable goals
- What students will be able to do after this lesson
- Specific skills or knowledge gained
```

### 3. Step-by-Step Content
```markdown
## 1. Concept Introduction
Explain the concept with real-world analogies

## 2. Detailed Explanation
Break down the concept into digestible parts

## 3. Code Examples
Provide working code with explanations

## 4. Practice Exercises
Hands-on activities to reinforce learning
```

### 4. AI Learning Support
```markdown
## AI Learning Prompt
Copy-paste prompt for ChatGPT/Claude to get additional help
```

### 5. Key Takeaways and Navigation
```markdown
## Key Takeaways
- Important concepts to remember
- Common pitfalls to avoid

## Next Steps
What to learn next

**Next Lesson**: [Next Lesson Title](next_lesson_file.md)
```

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style
- **Beginner-friendly**: Assume no prior knowledge
- **Step-by-step**: Break complex concepts into small steps
- **Practical**: Include real-world examples and analogies
- **Interactive**: Provide exercises and code examples

### Code Examples
- Include working code snippets
- Explain each line or section
- Provide context for when to use the code
- Include error handling examples

### Visual Elements
- Use clear headings and subheadings
- Include code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Add diagrams or ASCII art when helpful
- Use bullet points and numbered lists


## Best Practices

### Content Creation
1. **Start with the end in mind**: What should students be able to do?
2. **Use progressive complexity**: Build from simple to advanced concepts
3. **Include practical examples**: Real-world applications and use cases
4. **Provide multiple learning paths**: Visual, textual, and hands-on approaches

### Technical Writing
1. **Be consistent**: Use the same terminology throughout
2. **Explain the "why"**: Don't just show how, explain why
3. **Anticipate questions**: Address common confusions upfront
4. **Include troubleshooting**: Common errors and solutions

### Student Experience
1. **Clear navigation**: Easy to find next steps
2. **Self-assessment**: Ways for students to check understanding
3. **Multiple resources**: Text, code, AI prompts, external links
4. **Encouragement**: Positive reinforcement and motivation
